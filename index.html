                            <p>
                                Hello, I’m Joseph Stanley Happ, and
                                I'm an 18-year-old RMIT student currently studying my first semester of a Bachelor of
                                Information Technology. 
                                <br><br>I’m from Newcastle, NSW but have been living in inner
                                city Melbourne for the past 11 years. My ancestry is all German if you go back far
                                enough, but I’m a 4th generation Australian. 
                                <br><br>I speak English, as well as a beginner’s level of Auslan. I’ve been doing some Japanese self-study in the past year
                                and have enrolled in a Japanese TAFE course that begins on the 6th of April this year.
                                This is due to one of my major hobbies being reading Japanese manga and novels, as well
                                as having a great deal of interest in Japanese culture and media. 
                                <br><br>Another major hobby of mine is listening to music. I try to listen to at least 7 or 8 new albums a
                                week, and I listen to an average of about 
                                albums per day of various genres including
                                progressive rock, hip-hop, jazz fusion, black metal, and many, many others.
                                <br><br>Other (more social) hobbies I enjoy include playing tabletop roleplaying games,
                                reading about and discussing/debating politics and philosophy, as well as partying with
                                friends.

                            <p>
                                I’ve always been an introverted nerd who would spend all my time watching a computer
                                monitor in a dark room, but my interest in IT properly began when I took a class called
                                ‘Programming for Design’ in year 10. This class was about building fundamental skills in
                                JavaScript, and immediately after being given the first assignment, I went home and
                                worked at it for about 8 hours straight, having the time of my life. Since then, I’ve
                                been passionate about my enjoyment for programming and have given my all in both
                                personal and school programming projects. 
                                <br><br>I received the Outstanding Achievement Award
                                for achieving the highest score in the Northcote High School year 12 class of VCE
                                Applied Computing: Software Development, which involved getting a score of 80/80 for the
                                programming project assessment. This programming project was a JavaScript tool including
                                jQuery and Firebase (that can be found
                                <a href="https://bigunclejoe.github.io/pathfinder-character-tracker/">here</a>) with the purpose of
                                simplifying character management within complex tabletop roleplaying systems. This was
                                to assist in the D&D games I played with my friends at the time, which involved rulesets
                                outside of the scope of existing character management tools, an issue which was remedied
                                by my software solution.

                                Outside of my love for programming, a field of IT that also greatly interests me is data
                                security, specifically of data online. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been greatly
                                conscious of political and societal issues, and having done much reading and writing
                                about the frightening prospect of developing technologies and greater global
                                interconnectivity via the internet leading to the abuse of freedom online at the hands
                                of authoritarian governments and major corporations and tech giants. For this reason, I
                                am fascinated by the prospect of the use of IT in the fight for freedom online. After
                                seeing reactions to this fear of the violation of personal freedoms, such as the private
                                and secure alternative web browser Brave growing from less than 12 million users in
                                February 2020 to over 25 million as of February 2021 and the growth of various
                                cryptocurrencies as a secure and decentralised method of online trade, I am greatly
                                inspired to involve contribution to this critically important effort within my career in
                                the IT industry. <br><br>I chose to come to RMIT due to it being consistently ranked as
                                one of the top universities for IT in Melbourne and hope to further enhance and gain a
                                large variety of tech-related skills including programming, user-centred design,
                                networking, data and network security, as well as professional communication skills such
                                as networking and teamwork.

                                My ideal job would allow me to pursue my passion of online security and freedom. This
                                would involve working for a technology company/organisation that is improving the online
                                space (i.e. Brave and The Tor Project), rather than one which is actively contributing
                                to its degeneration (i.e. Google and Facebook). For this reason, I would be interested
                                in software development work for browsers such as Tor and Brave that are open-source and
                                allow for users to browse the internet without being monitored and taken advantage of.

                                These positions are ideal for the following reasons:
                                <br><br>-	Median salary of $130,000 USD per annum
                                <br>o	According to most job finding websites, these positions typically pay (in the US, where these positions are located) a great deal, which would make for a steady financial situation and a large disposable income.
                                <br><br>-	Benefits
                                <br>o	Both offer benefits including paid leave and medical insurance, with Brave also offering stock options and ‘a generous 401k plan’.
                                <br><br>-	Remote work
                                <br>o	These US-based positions are advertised with the option of completely remote work, meaning I can stay in Melbourne; a city which I love a great deal.
                                <br><br>-	Interaction primarily with development team
                                <br>o	While user and client interaction are of course an important part of development projects, my skills, personality, and passions are more focused on the technical side of development. These positions are far more development-centric than user/client-centric.

                                In order to gain the skills required to be employed to these positions, I’ll have to work hard to excel in related classes during my education at RMIT, especially ones related to software/web development using both front-end and back-end technologies and ones involving security related to data and networks. This will build a strong basis of technical skill which I can use to find employment to further enhance them. <br><br>During and after my time at RMIT, I need to build experience to show that I am fit for the position. Building a profile of personal software projects will show a passion for development. Doing volunteer work and internships for tech organisations, especially those involved in online protection (i.e. Tor), will show a passion for security and freedom on the internet. Succeeding in professional environments working with frameworks and systems specified in the position requirements (Ruby, Java, etc.) will show competence and a drive to produce high quality outcomes.

                                My Turbulent Logician/INTP-T personality type reflects that I value my creativity and inventiveness, as well as my skill in finding problems and working through solutions. I often work through issues with others, but ultimately get results on my own. Being ‘turbulent’ rather than ‘assertive’, I often lack some confidence, yet I hold flexible goals, and open up to those around me more easily.

                                My learning style is primarily that of a pragmatist, illustrating my affinity for practical and experimental work, trial and error, and brisk discussion of core concepts. 
                                <br><br>I also possess qualities of a reflector; namely my tendency to stand back and think on key parts of whatever I’m learning about to consolidate my understanding of it, as well as that of a theorist; namely in how I like to have confidence in my understanding of how key elements of a concept fit together before diving into practical work to apply and deepen that understanding in a hands-on environment.
                                <br><br>I have almost no activist qualities, as I prefer to have a measured understanding of something before engaging with it, rather than diving into it without thought.

                            The Big 5 Personalities Test shows my moderate love for socialisation and interaction, having higher ‘extroversion’ than most, as well as my tendency for large changes in my mood and being easily excitable, as my ‘emotional stability’ is far lower than average. 
                            <br><br>It also shows how I can often be highly critical of others’ ideas while also acting on impulse at times, having lower ‘agreeableness’ and ‘conscientiousness’ than most. 
                            <br><br>What I exhibit most prominently is my love for new experiences and gaining newfound knowledge, shown by my much-higher-than-average ‘intellect/imagination’.

                        These 3 tests show my main attributes as being highly responsive to innovative, practical, flexible, and creative approaches to problem solving and learning, often taking the time to think through the big picture. 
                        <br><br>In a team environment, I am open for discussion with others as a supplement to my own thinking, but ultimately take advantage of those main attributes to accomplish tasks on my own. 
                        <br><br>When forming a team including me, it would be best to have a distribution of people who are capable of responsible delegation and task management to ensure that I have a set of tasks that I can accomplish independently of others, maximising my own effectiveness and ensuring that my work does not overlap or get in the way of my teammates. Organisational and people-centred tasks should ideally be accomplished by others in the group who specialise in these skills.

                        These tests are consistent in their categorisation of me as a measured thinker who enjoys finding practical solutions through creative means, however there is some inconsistency between my extroversion and introversion between tests. This may be due to how I respond to different social situations; finding a great deal of enjoyment in interacting with close friends but feeling reluctant to work closely with colleagues and trusting myself to get the job done. This seems to conflict with my Turbulent Logician trait as someone who lacks confidence, but I believe this matches up with my low emotional stability score from the Big 5 Personalities Test as I can often quickly switch between great self-assuredness and self-doubt. 
                        <br><br>The validity of these tests is not indisputable, but I do believe they do accurately create a profile of myself as being a strong independent thinker and creative practical worker, both of which being greatly relevant to my skillset and place in a team environment.

        </div>
        <div class="columns is-multiline is-desktop">
            <div class="column">
                <article>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            My idea for a project is a text-based combat-focused Role-Playing Game (RPG) made in Python using the Pathfinder Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) system and involving randomly generated, rather than pre-scripted, combat, and narrative scenarios and sequences.
                            <br><br>Pathfinder is a hugely fun system with a lot of complexity that allows for huge levels of customisability and leads to some considerably enjoyable emergent gameplay. Pathfinder does have a video game version called Kingmaker; however, this has widely been criticised (see: countless user reviews) for its underwhelming and often dull writing, as well as its extreme lack of faith towards the tabletop rules and system. On top of this, most mods of the game that make improvements are no longer supported, such as the Turn-Based Combat mod which restored the original turn system. 
                            <br><br>Additionally, an issue with pre-written story pathways aside from their quality is their repetition. The fun of TTRPGs is the prospect of experiencing completely new things each time you play, as the boundaries of a TTRPG narrative are endless. Being forced into playing through the same storyline over and over, as seen in Kingmaker as well as essentially any pre-written TTRPG video game adaptation, takes the fun out of it to an extreme degree. 
                            <br><br>Conversely, randomly generated RPGs such as aidungeon.io do provide enjoyable and unique experiences, but they do not use RPG systems, and the user only manipulates the direction of a random narrative’s algorithm rather than being presented with a set of defined limits and options that make character-driven role-playing so satisfying. A randomly generated narrative where a player can act using the true Pathfinder ruleset would serve as an enjoyable alternative to Kingmaker by doing everything it does wrong right.
                            <br><br>As well as wishing to create a product that is enjoyable and accurate to what fans of the original system want, another purpose of this project is to assist me as a programmer by serving as a major undertaking through which to grow my skills in Python. This is a language that I have recently started learning and must gain a high level of competence at to be considered for many development positions due to its ubiquitousness.

                        <p>
                            The product itself will be a Python program with the ruleset of Pathfinder built in. This includes distance matrices, combat systems and interactions, races and classes, skills and spells, and all the information and statistics about these parts of the game. The scope of the inclusions would not include the entirety of the system (as that would require a significantly larger development team), but just the core ruleset without any of the (many, many) additions to the system. 
                            <br><br>The program would use this information to assign information and parameters to objects (characters) within the game. The program will allow a player to create and fully customise a Pathfinder character – choosing a level, name, class, background, alignment, stats, skills, feats, etc. – and manipulate that character within the game until either the character is killed, or the game is otherwise ended. 
                            <br><br>The player, upon creating a character, will have the option to select some parameters for the environment in which the character will initialise. This will primarily include a setting, such as a castle, a forest, a city, a ship, etc. which would limit the set of encounter possibilities to options broadly related to this setting. For example, upon choosing a forest environment, the game will choose from a list of possible characters with the ‘forest’ value (i.e. goblins, gnomes, gripplis, etc.) and choose them for the encounter as either enemies or interactable non-player characters (NPCs). 
                            <br><br>A typical game will run through a short scenario within the selected setting comprised of some small number of encounters with enemies and/or other NPCs. Upon the player character’s survival, the game will come to a close with either the option to close the campaign permanently or continue with the same character onto a new setting.

                        In-game, a player will be able to see a range of information and options for interacting with the game world. 
                    The program will show a column listing all information about the player character on the left side of the UI. 
                    <br><br>A column serving as a log for any relevant information will be shown on the right side of the UI. This will allow the player to input text at will so the player does not have to tab out of the application or write physical notes if there is some mechanic, etc. within the game that requires the player to check some information. 
                    <br><br>The main part of the program will be the log of scenario text. This will describe to the player what is happening within the game, what characters say and do, including the effects of the player character’s actions. 
                    <br><br>The player will be able to choose action types from a dropdown at the bottom of the UI. Action types include interact, speak, skill, feat, weapon, defence, spell, etc. and after being selected, the dropdown to the right will give specific options for that selected action type. Options might include ‘attack with sword’ after choosing ‘weapon’ or ‘taunt your enemy’ after selecting ‘speak’.

                        To complete this project, all that is needed is the Pathfinder SRD website, Python 3.x installed, and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code that support and include features for programming in Python. Additionally, a GUI framework for Python could be used, such as wxPython which is simple and open-source, ideal for the basic UI of this project.
                        <br><br>Knowledge of Python is the main condition for making this project a success, and to gain the required knowledge, experience working with the language must be built up. Working on quick, smaller, related projects before this one begins such as building a similar GUI, making scripts that generate random strings of text from option lists, making scripts wherein two characters with stat blocks make decisions during combat with each other, etc. These will work as good preparatory exercises and may also serve as the basis for some parts of the code in the project itself.

                    <p>
                        The successful completion of this project will have two outcomes. The first will be that players of the Pathfinder TTRPG system who would like to interact with it in a single player setting and do not wish to use Kingmaker will have an option to have that experience available to them with this program. 
                        <br><br>The program should have a list of features that, while not exhaustive, should contain a significant enough portion of the system’s ruleset, as well as a list of possible settings, characters, actions, etc. as expansive enough that the game will have a high level of replay value. 
                        <br><br>The second outcome will be that I will have grown as a Python programmer, with a quality program under my belt to show potential employers my value as a programmer and to use as a steppingstone to move onto larger projects and improve my skills even more so.
